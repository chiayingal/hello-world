# Example dataset 2 from the back of the lecture notes brick.

# The Forbes data (a classic calibration problem)

# Read in the data:

Forbes <- read.table("F:/STAT/STAT2008/Datasets (text)/Forbes.txt", header=T)
Forbes

# Attach and plot the data:

attach(Forbes)
plot(Boiling.point, Pressure)

# A SLR certainly looks plausible:

Forbes.lm <- lm(Pressure ~ Boiling.point)

# Add the model to the plot we created earlier:

abline(Forbes.lm$coef)

# Looks good, but we should check the plots:

plot(Forbes.lm, which=1)

# There is definite pattern to the residuals here, suggesting a violation
# of the assumption that the errors are independent or uncorrelated.
# We do not appear to have an appropriate model. We need to fix the 
# model before we go any further.

# Note that if we do just continue regardless, we would end up making 
# some strong inferences with what is arguably an inapproriate model:

plot(Forbes.lm)

# We could try modelling the relationship with a quadratic model
# rather than a straight line - this takes us into the area of 
# multiple regression models (covered later in this course).
# Here is a "sneak" preview:

Forbes.qm <- lm(Pressure ~ Boiling.point + I(Boiling.point^2))
plot(Forbes.qm)
plot(Forbes.qm, which=4)

anova(Forbes.qm)
summary(Forbes.qm)

# Another possible solution is to try a transformation on one or both
# of the variables (response and/or explanatory). Let's graph a few 
# possible scale transformations in the power family:

x <- 0:1000/10
plot(x, x, , type="l", ylab="transformed (x)")
lines(x, x^2, lty=2)
lines(x, sqrt(x), lty=3)
lines(x, log(x), lty=4)
lines(x, 1/x, lty=5)

# There are some problems, if x can have negative values, x squared is
# not a monotonic transformation. The inverse 1/x is monotonically
# decreasing rather than increasing, it rather reverses the data order.
# log() and 1/x have problems with both negative values and zero values:

x[1:12]
log(x)[1:12]
1/x[1:12]

# There are no zero values of the Y variable in the Forbes data, so
# we can try the transformation suggested by Forbes (see the
# description of the data in the brick):

Pressure
log(Pressure)

plot(Boiling.point, log(Pressure))
Forbes.loglm <- lm(log(Pressure) ~ Boiling.point)
abline(Forbes.loglm$coef)

# Again, this looks like a good fit, but we should closely examine the
# residual plots:

plot(Forbes.loglm)
plot(Forbes.loglm, which=4)

# The transformation appears to have solved some of the problems, but
# there is a still an obvious potential outlier (observation 12).
# We can check what the model would look like without this data point:

Forbes.loglm2 <- lm(log(Pressure[-12]) ~ Boiling.point[-12])
plot(Forbes.loglm2)
plot(Forbes.loglm2, which=4)

# Most things looking better, but now there is hint that observation 1
# is now a problem. This often happens when we don't have the right 
# scale for the variables (i.e. we haven't yet found the scale on 
# which the relationship is approximately linear). The qq plot 
# suggests that the log() transformation may have been a little 
# too "strong", so maybe we should try a sqrt() transformation:

Forbes.sqrtlm <- lm(sqrt(Pressure[-12]) ~ Boiling.point[-12])
plot(Forbes.sqrtlm)

# Arguably there are still some problems and we are in real danger of
# over-working a dataset with only 17 observations (16 once we have
# excluding an outlier). We could keep going or simply chose the best
# of a bad bunch of candidate models and see what light it can shed 
# on the underlying research question.

# There may be could good underlying scientific reasons that Forbes 
# suggested the log model, though we probably do need to worry about
# the obvious outlier, so let's take a closer look at the log model
# excluding the outlier:

Forbes.loglm2
plot(Forbes.loglm2)
plot(Forbes.loglm2, which=4)

anova(Forbes.loglm2)
summary(Forbes.loglm2)

# So, if this is our best candidate model, it does seem to suggest
# there is significant relationship between Pressure (on a log scale)
# and Boiling Point, as suggested by Forbes, but excluding the effects
# of observation 12 as a potential outlier - we can tell this from 
# either the F=32485 on 1 and 14 degrees of freedom which has a 
# p-value a lot lower than 0.05 or from the t statistic associated 
# with Boiling.point of -41.2 on 14 df, with the same p-value.

# Note if we want to evaluate this model on the original scale,
# we will need to back-transform:

plot(Boiling.point, Pressure)
lines(Boiling.point[-12], exp(fitted(Forbes.loglm2)))

# Note the slight curve to the line and the "glitch" around a
# a Boiling point of 208 to 209 (note unlike the description in the
# brick, these data are in degrees Fahrenheit, not Celsius), where
# the data were not totally sorted in order:

Boiling.point

# We can do a better job by creating some sorted X values and using
# the model to predict the Y values, but first we need to re-fit the
# model as predict has trouble dealing with the exclusion of the 
# outlier:

bpoint <- Boiling.point[-12]
lpressure <- log(Pressure[-12])
Forbes.loglm3 <- lm(lpressure ~ bpoint)

bpoints <- 190:215
bpoints
logpress <- predict(Forbes.loglm3, newdata=data.frame(bpoint=bpoints), interval="prediction")
logpress
class(logpress)

plot(Boiling.point, Pressure)
lines(bpoints, exp(logpress[,"fit"]))
lines(bpoints, exp(logpress[,"lwr"]), lty=2)
lines(bpoints, exp(logpress[,"upr"]), lty=2)

# The 95% prediction intervals include all of the points actually 
# used to fit the model, but do not include the outlier.
