# Example 2 from page 12 of chapter 2 of the lecture notes:
# Pine tree data (see description in the "brick")

# Taking another look at this example - again read in and attach the 
# data and recalculate the transformed variables: 

pine <- read.table("F:/STAT/STAT2008/Datasets (text)/pine.txt",header=T)
pine
attach(pine)

x1 <- HD
x2 <- AGE*N
x3 <- HD/N
pairs(cbind(x1,x2,x3,MDBH))

# Given that order is important, we could fit various multiple regression
# model involving all three explanatory variables:

pine.lm231 <- lm(MDBH ~ x2 + x3 + x1)
pine.lm231
anova(pine.lm231)

# Judging by the ANOVA table, x1 does appear to be a significant addition
# to a model that already involves x2 and x3, but let's look at the added
# variable plot:

pine.lm23 <- lm(MDBH ~ x2 + x3)
x1.lm23 <- lm(x1 ~ x2 + x3)

plot(residuals(x1.lm23), residuals(pine.lm23),xlab="residuals(x1 on x2+x3)", ylab="residuals(MDBH on x2+x3)")
abline(0, coef(pine.lm231)[4])
title("Added variable plot for x1")

cor(residuals(x1.lm23), residuals(pine.lm23))

# Note the reasonably strong correlation between these residuals, and 
# compare with the simple linear regression of MDBH on just x1:

plot(x1, MDBH)
abline(lm(MDBH ~ x1))
title("SLR of MDBH on x1")

cor(x1, MDBH)

# There is obviously a strong linear relationship between MDBH and x1,
# a relationship which is only modified slightly by the prior inclusion
# of x2 and x3 in a multiple regression model.

# Repeat the analysis for x2:

pine.lm132 <- lm(MDBH ~ x1 + x3 + x2)
pine.lm132
anova(pine.lm132)

pine.lm13 <- lm(MDBH ~ x1 + x3)
x2.lm13 <- lm(x2 ~ x1 + x3)

plot(residuals(x2.lm13), residuals(pine.lm13),xlab="residuals(x2 on x1+x3)", ylab="residuals(MDBH on x1+x3)")
abline(0, coef(pine.lm132)[4])
title("Added variable plot for x2")

cor(residuals(x2.lm13), residuals(pine.lm13))

plot(x2, MDBH)
abline(lm(MDBH ~ x2))
title("SLR of MDBH on x2")

cor(x2, MDBH)

# x2 does appear to be a significant addition to a MR model which already
# includes x1 and x3, but the prior inclusion of x1 and x3 has definitely
# modified the relationship between MDBH and x2.

# Repeat the analysis for x3:

pine.lm123 <- lm(MDBH ~ x1 + x2 + x3)
pine.lm123
anova(pine.lm123)

pine.lm12 <- lm(MDBH ~ x1 + x2)
x3.lm12 <- lm(x3 ~ x1 + x2)

plot(residuals(x3.lm12), residuals(pine.lm12),xlab="residuals(x3 on x1+x2)", ylab="residuals(MDBH on x1+x2)")
abline(0, coef(pine.lm123)[4])
title("Added variable plot for x3")

cor(residuals(x3.lm12), residuals(pine.lm12))

plot(x3, MDBH)
abline(lm(MDBH ~ x3))
title("SLR of MDBH on x3")

cor(x3, MDBH)

# x3 does not appear to be a significant addition to a MR model which
# already includes x1 and x2, and the prior inclusion of x1 and x2 has
# definitely modified the relationship between MDBH and x3.

# In the earlier analysis of the Forestry (pine) data, we also thought
# that observation 20 was a potential outlier, which may have affected
# the fit of all the above models. We can have a look at the various 
# influence measures for the model that includes all 3 variables:

help(influence)

influence(pine.lm123)

# The hat or leverage (hii) values are in $hat, which we can also
# get using hat.values() on the model. Similarly, $coefficients 
# has the deletion coefficients and $sigma has the deletion residual
# standard deviations. We can also use similar functions to
# hat.values() to get other influence measures.

help(influence.measures)

# Not the most informative help file, but as we have seen earlier:
# rstandard() gives PRESS or internally studentised residuals (ri), 
# rstudent() gives externally studentised residuals (ti),
# dffits(), cov.ratio(), cooks.distance() are obvious and
# dfbeta() just gives the deletion coefficients, whilst dfbetas()
# gives the DFBETAS - be careful with these two.

dfbetas(pine.lm123)

# Observation 20 is perturbing most of the model coefficients.

round(data.frame(DFFIT=dffits(pine.lm123),CooksD=cooks.distance(pine.lm123),COVRATIO=covratio(pine.lm123)),7)

# There are arbitrary cut-offs of some sort for most of these 
# (see the brick), but I tend not to trust any of them. I prefer
# to weigh all the evidence and interpret most of them in relative
# terms - problem observations have relatively large values.
# This comparison is best done graphically, for example:

plot(pine.lm123, which=4)

# Observation 20 does stand out. Is the better solution to 
# delete this observation or to modify the model to find
# the model which bests fits ALL the data, BEFORE we
# resolve any issues with potential outliers:

pine.lmWOobs20 <- lm(MDBH[-20] ~ x1[-20] + x2[-20] + x3[-20])
anova(pine.lmWOobs20)
summary(pine.lmWOobs20)
plot(pine.lmWOobs20, which=c(1,2,4,5))

# Compare with the full model on all 20 observations:

anova(pine.lm123)
summary(pine.lm123)
plot(pine.lm123, which=c(1,2,4,5))

# Compare with reduced model we get by deleting the non 
# significant variable x3, rather than part of the data:

anova(pine.lm12)
summary(pine.lm12)
plot(pine.lm12, which=c(1,2,4,5))

dfbetas(pine.lm12)

round(data.frame(DFFIT=dffits(pine.lm12),CooksD=cooks.distance(pine.lm12),COVRATIO=covratio(pine.lm12)),7)

# My preferred choice would be the last model, which 
# appears to model all the data!
