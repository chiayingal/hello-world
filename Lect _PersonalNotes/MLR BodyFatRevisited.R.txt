# To explore the issue of multicollinearity we will revisit
# Example 5 from page 17 of chapter 2 of the lecture notes:
# Body fat data (see description in the "brick")

bodyfat <- read.table("F:/STAT/STAT2008/Datasets (text)/bft.txt",header=T)
bodyfat

# Attach the data so we can access each of the various columns by name:

attach(bodyfat)

# To explore the data graphically in R, draw a scatterplot matrix:

pairs(bodyfat)

# There are definitely relationships between some of the 
# predictors for this sample of 20 women, notably the triceps
# skinfold and thigh circumference measurements and to a 
# lesser extent the triceps and the midarm circumference:

cor.test(Triceps, Thigh)
cor.test(Triceps, Midarm)
cor.test(Thigh, Midarm)

# Note, as is done in the brick, we could summarise these
# correlations in a correlation matrix for the X variables:

cor(cbind(Triceps, Thigh, Midarm))

# Inverting this matrix and taking the diagonal elements
# gives us the VIFs (Variance Inflation Factors):

diag(solve(cor(cbind(Triceps, Thigh, Midarm))))

# We could also derive these for each of the three variables
# using the formula given in the brick and the slides, for
# example for Triceps:

R2_Triceps <- summary(lm(Triceps ~ Thigh + Midarm))$r.squared
R2_Triceps
1/(1-R2_Triceps)

# Fitting the multiple regression model with all three variables:

bodyfat.lm <- lm(BodyFat ~ Triceps + Thigh + Midarm)
plot(bodyfat.lm, which=c(1,2,4,5))

# Nothing really wrong with underlying assumptions, however,
# we find the last variable is not significant and the standard
# errors for the coefficients do appear inflated (i.e. large 
# relative to the estimates):

anova(bodyfat.lm)
summary(bodyfat.lm)

# Note that Faraway's R package includes a handy function which
# will calculate VIFs from either a matrix of the X variables
# or even from a stored model object:

library(faraway)
help(vif)

vif(cbind(Triceps, Thigh, Midarm))
vif(bodyfat[,-4])
vif(bodyfat.lm)

# Given the very high bivariate correlation, the culprit is
# probably trying to include both Triceps and Thigh in the
# same model, so we could adopt the suggested strategy of
# removing the variable with the highest VIF (Triceps):

bodyfat.lm2 <- lm(BodyFat ~ Thigh + Midarm)
plot(bodyfat.lm2, which=c(1,2,4,5))

anova(bodyfat.lm2)
summary(bodyfat.lm2)
vif(bodyfat.lm2)

# Midarm is still not significant in the context of this
# model and there are some grounds for concern over the
# status of observation 3, but we do appear to have solved
# the multicollinearity problem. We could try dropping
# Thigh instead of Triceps:

bodyfat.lm3 <- lm(BodyFat ~ Triceps + Midarm)
plot(bodyfat.lm3, which=c(1,2,4,5))

anova(bodyfat.lm3)
summary(bodyfat.lm3)
vif(bodyfat.lm3)

# Still some concern over observation 3, but close to the
# the lowest RSE and the largest and most significant 
# overall F statistic of the three models, with no 
# apparent problem with multi-collinearity, but as it says
# in the brick "we now have a model which uses only 
# measurements on the the arm of the women, and this 
# seems rather unsoud from a medical and biological
# perspective.
