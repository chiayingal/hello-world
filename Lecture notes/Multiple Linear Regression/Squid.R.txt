# Example 1 from page 5 of chapter 2 of the lecture notes:
# Squid data (see description in the "brick")

squid <- read.table("F:/STAT/STAT2008/Datasets (text)/Squid.txt",header=T)
squid

# Attach the data so we can access each of the various columns by name:

attach(squid)

# To explore the data graphically in R, draw a scatterplot matrix:

pairs(squid)

# The relationships between the response variable, weight and the
# various x variables all appear roughly linear with some possible 
# curvature in some of the relationships. Note there are also strong 
# relationships between the various x variables.

# A initial multiple regression model could plausibly be:

squid.lm <- lm(weight ~ x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)
squid.lm

# The slope coefficents are partial regression coefficients, but there
# are relationships between the x variables, so trying to increase one
# x variable by 1, whilst holding the others constant is not easily 
# done in practice. The model is additive, so as all variables increase
# by 1, the expected increase in Y would be the sum of the slopes.
# Note that the coefficients are different to what we would get from
# 5 different simple linear regessions:

lm(weight ~ x1)
lm(weight ~ x2)
lm(weight ~ x3)
lm(weight ~ x4)
lm(weight ~ x5)
squid.lm

# Also note that the intercept lies outside the range of our data,
# even if we were to attempt a direct interpretation:

apply(squid, 2, min)
apply(squid, 2, max)
apply(squid, 2, range)

# The residual diagnostic plots, however, suggest there are problems 
# with this intial model:

plot(squid.lm)

# We can also get a simpler bar plot of Cook's distances:

plot(squid.lm, which=4)

# Thinking about the data, the x variables are all measurements of 
# length and the response variable is more closely related to the 
# overall size (volume) of the squid.  Like multiplying the sides 
# of a rectangular prism to find the volume, we might expect a 
# multiplicative relationship between the x variables and the weight.  
# Applying a log transformation to all variables can transform
# this multiplicative relationship to an additive one
# (and is often used in this type of situation):

squid.loglm <- lm(log(weight) ~ log(x1) + log(x2) + log(x3) + log(x4) + log(x5))

# The diagnostic plots suggest a linear model fitted on the 
# transformed scale is much closer to being an appropriate model: 

plot(squid.loglm)

# We might go further down this line of trying to find the right
# scale for this multivariate relationship later, but for now,
# we will use the untransformed model to examine some of the 
# properties of multivariate relationships:

# For example, the ANOVA table suggests that might be some extraneous
# terms in this model (some of the F tests do not have significant
# p-values).

anova(squid.lm)

# This is probably because the x variables are closely related to each
# other. This is an example of multicollinearity.
# Not an extreme example, as we can still fit the model - we do not
# have the problem where one of x variables is a perfect linear
# combination of the other x variables.

# Because of these realtionships between the X variables, the order
# we choose to fit the variables into the model makes a difference.
# Not to the overall fit of the model (the plots are unchanged), 
# but to which variables we consider important: 

squid.lm2 <- lm(weight ~ x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x1)

plot(squid.lm)
plot(squid.lm2)

anova(squid.lm)
anova(squid.lm2)

# Note that it is the analysis of the different sources of variance
# that has changed when we re-ordered the model, not the partial
# regression coefficients:

squid.lm
squid.lm2

summary(squid.lm)
summary(squid.lm2)

# Note the overall ANOVA is the same for both models:

anova(lm(weight ~ cbind(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5)))
anova(lm(weight ~ cbind(x5, x4, x3, x2, x1)))

# In the ANOVA tables, where we fit the variables separately,
# the effect of each additional variable is assessed sequentially
# in the order in which the predictors were listed, which is why
# only the t test for the last variable fitted is directly equivalent
# to the sequential F test for the same variable:

anova(squid.lm)
summary(squid.lm)

anova(squid.lm2)
summary(squid.lm2)

# The t test are marginal tests - are the effects of that variable
# significant, after we have accounted for the other variables in the
# model?

# If we want to test a subset of predictors, we can use change the
# order and group the variables. For example, are x4 and x5 a 
# significant addition to a model that already includes x1, x2 and x3?

anova(lm(weight ~ cbind(x1, x2, x3) + cbind(x4, x5)))

# Another example (also in the "brick"), are x4 and x1 a significant
# addition to a model that already includes x2, x3 and x5?

anova(lm(weight ~ cbind(x2, x3, x5) + cbind(x4, x1)))

# We will come back to this comparison of nested models, when we 
# look at the idea of refining a complicated regression model.
